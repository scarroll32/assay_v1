.current blue = current step
light gray = cannot yet be seleted
.done dark gray = has been completed but user can go back
.ready green = ready to be processed (user to click)
.processing yellow = background processing
.error orange = error in this step (message will display in error box)

		fields are unlocked
		user must select a primer3 default.
	if user selects a primer3 default
		:configure is blue
		:primer3 is green, meaning the user can press then step of the pipeline
		user can change settings on individual primer3 lines
		if user presses :primer3 to background process primer3
			primer3 goes yellow (processing)
	when primer3 completes succussfully
		:primer3 = blue
		:assay = green
		user can review primer3 info or click on assay to review
